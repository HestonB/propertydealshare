                <p>
                  Like many property investors, we started our journey in
                  countless WhatsApp groups, trying to piece together deals from
                  scattered messages and incomplete information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The frustration was real - missed opportunities, unreliable
                  sources, and hours wasted scrolling through chat groups. We
                  knew there had to be a better way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That's when Property Deal Share was born. We set out to create
                  what we wished existed: a professional platform where serious
                  investors could connect with verified sourcers, access
                  detailed deal information, and make confident investment
                  decisions.
